__author__ : Samuel Berrien

## Description
The final goal of this project is to implement any kind of optimisation algorithm in order to teach creature to walk, run etc.

We will first try to reproduce the results of the article [Flexible Muscle-Based Locomotion for Bipedal Creatures](https://www.goatstream.com/research/papers/SA2013/SA2013.pdf).

## Requirements
This project requires multiple libraries.

* Physic engine stuff : Bullet

* Graphic stuff : OpenGL, GLM, GLEW, GLFW and SOIL

* Reinforcement Learning : LibTorch
